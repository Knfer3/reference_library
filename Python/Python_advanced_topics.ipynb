    "### Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create Generators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly simple to create a generator in Python. It is as easy as defining a normal function, but with a `yield` statement instead of a `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that while a return statement terminates a function entirely, yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls."
